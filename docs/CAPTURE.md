# Bank-push capture

For a contributor changing how the app turns a bank's push notifications into recommendations. It covers the capture
key, which is built; the endpoint that accepts it and the screens that show recommendations are added as they land.

A person's phone runs a Shortcuts automation for each bank app and posts each notification with a capture key. The app
only ever adds a recommendation the person edits and submits, never an expense of its own.

## The capture key

A key is `xpk_<16 hex>_<64 hex>`. The first part is a public id the server looks the key up by. The second is the
secret, 256 random bits, of which only a SHA-256 is stored. Hex rather than base64url so a `_` can only be the
separator, and a fixed length so one pattern refuses anything else before any lookup. The code is in
[`captureKey.ts`](../src/domain/capture/captureKey.ts).

- **Made in Settings** by the signed-in person, behind the capture flag (`?capture=on`, kept in the browser; off by
  default). The owner is the verified email and nothing in the body can change it.
- **Shown once.** The create call returns the whole key and nothing else ever does. The list returns id, name, when it
  was made and when it was last used.
- **Three at a time** per person, checked inside the insert so two requests made at once cannot make a fourth. A fourth
  is a 409. Replacing a key is making a new one, then revoking the old.
- **Revoked, not deleted.** The row is kept, and the limit counts live keys only, so revoking frees a slot. Revoking takes effect on the next request the key makes. Another person's key, a revoked key
  and an unknown id all answer 404, so ids cannot be probed.
- **Compared as digests.** The endpoint compares the SHA-256 of the secret it was sent with the stored one, using
  `crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual` where the runtime has it and a loop over all 32 bytes where it does not.
- **A key opens one door.** The management routes live under `/api` and need the sign-in, so a key sent to them is a 401
  like any request with no identity.

## Routes

| Route | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/capture-keys` | `{ keys: [{ keyId, label, createdAt, lastUsedAt }] }`, newest first, live keys only |
| `POST /api/capture-keys` | 201 with the same fields and `key`. Body: a JSON object with an optional `label` (at most 40 characters, no control characters; blank becomes "Shortcut"), at most 1 KB. 409 at the limit |
| `DELETE /api/capture-keys/:id` | `{ ok: true }`, or 404 |

These writes leave the owner's dataset revision alone, since they change nothing a
ledger reader sees; the exemption is in [`_middleware.ts`](../functions/api/_middleware.ts).
